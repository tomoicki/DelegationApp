        # FIXME:
        # Here we are returning a static token, which is assigned to the user
        # and stored inside a DB. Later it is used to recognize a user.
        # This is an over-complicated ugly reimplementation of well known "basic auth"
        # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication
        # The main difference - we use some "random" token instead of `f"{user}:{passwd}"` string.
        #
        # Such method might Ok if you run your site under the HTTPS.
        # S is essential here, otherwise token might be easily stolen by sniffing a network.
        # Which is veery serious security issue.
        # 
        # If that is ok - then basic auth should be used instead of reinventing the wheel.
        # All http clients support it, all http-proxies know what to do with it.
        # Browsers will show a password prompt when HTTP server request this auth type.
        # You can be sure that this header will not be logged on some server/proxy. etc.
        # 
        # If some more sophisticted mechanizm is required - tokens can be used.
        # But they should be generated for a some period of time, stored into the DB.
        # Some additional checks might be added - like check token is used only by a single IP etc.
        # Anyway it is better to use existing solution. And of course you can go inside it
        # and look how it is implemented, learn some patterns etc.
